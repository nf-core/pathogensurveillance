The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/results).\n\n## Pipeline summary\n\n![](docs/images/pipeline_diagram.png)\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nNote that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software.\nThis is usually done in the form of a config profile (`<REPLACE WITH RUN TOOL>` in the examples below).\nYou can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.\nBefore using you own data, consider trying out a small example dataset included with the pipeline as a profile.\nAvailable test dataset profiles include:\n\n- `test_serratia`: Test profile of 10 serratia isolates from Williams et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32929-2)\n- `test_bordetella`: Test profile of 5 Bordetella pertussis isolates sequenced with with Illumina and Nanopore from Wagner et al. 2023\n- `test_salmonella`: Test profile of 5 salmonella isolates from Hawkey et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54418-4)\n- `test_boxwood_blight`: Test profile of 5 samples of the boxwood blight fungus Cylindrocladium buxicola from LeBlanc et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-06-20-0219-FI)\n- `test_mycobacteroides`: Test profile of 5 Mycobacteroides abscessus samples from Bronson et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25484-9)\n- `test_bacteria`: Test profile of 10 mixed bacteria from various sources\n- `test_klebsiella`: Test profile of 10 K. pneumoniae and related species from Holt et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1501049112)\n- `test_small_genomes`: Test profile consisting of 6 samples from species with small genomes from various sources.\n\nAdding `_full` to the end of any of these profiles will run a larger (often much larger) version of these datasets.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/pathogensurveillance -profile <REPLACE WITH RUN TOOL>,bacteria -resume --outdir test_output\n```\n\nTo run your own input data, prepare a samplesheet as described in the [usage documentation](docs/usage/#samplesheet-input) section below and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/pathogensurveillance -profile <REPLACE WITH RUN TOOL> -resume --sample_data <REPLACE WITH TSV/CSV> --outdir <REPLACE WITH OUTPUT PATH>\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- `<REPLACE WITH RUN TOOL>` is one of docker, singularity, podman, shifter, charliecloud, or conda\n- `<REPLACE WITH TSV/CSV>` is the path to the input samplesheet\n- `<REPLACE WITH OUTPUT PATH>` is the path to where to save the output\n\nYou can see the samplesheets used in these profiles here:\n\nhttps://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/pathogensurveillance\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/parameters).\nTo see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.\nFor more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the [output documentation](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/output).\n\n## Credits\n\nThe following people contributed to the pipeline: Zachary S.L.
